Considering that:

* A **central European Patent Court will create caselaw in favour of software patents**, as it has been recognised by several experts [1];
* Software patents, despite their exclusion in the law, has been validated in countries like Germany (Siemens case) or the UK ([Halliburton case](http://www.appleyardlees.com/software-patents-in-the-uk-halliburton-energy-incs-patent.html));
* Large companies have been calling for rejection of the previous failed software patent directive, pushing for the creation of the such Central European Patent Court instead;
* Software Patents make software development risky and impossible, depriving their authors and companies of their rights;
* The fundamental right of programmers to give instructions to programmable machines should not be limited by patent law;

We ask lawmakers:

* make the European Court of Justice (CJEU) the ultimate arbitrer in patent law (art 6-8);
