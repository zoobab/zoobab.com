# About


I bought a pair of wheels on a 50% discount at the end of the year 2016, a [<http://www.superstarcomponents.com/en/stans-fuel-blowout-sale-wheelset.htm>   pair of ZTR Flow MK2 with Superstar Fuel hubs], for an amazing price of 150eur (130GBP):

> We have teamed up wiht Stans rims to clear the last of the best selling MK2 Stans rims at a crazy never to be repeated price. Strictly limited quantities, once they are gone they are gone... Built with Fuel 60 engagement hubs with SKF bearings, Sapim double butted black Race spokes and Brass nipples. This build ticks all the quality boxes and is ready to rip the trails.

Superstar says those hubs are manufactured in France, and my comments did not appear on their [<http://www.superstarcomponents.com/en/fuel-rear-hub.htm>   Fuel hubs product page], that´s my main reason for writing this page.

After a while listing the potential manufacturers, I found that those hubs are in fact [<http://www.aivee.fr/fr/univers-vtt-aivee/moyeux/mt2-detail.html>   Aivee MT2 hubs], their webpage says those hubs are only available to wheels manufacturers "Les MT2 sont disponibles à la vente uniquement pour les OEM et les monteurs de roues".

They also mention "3 cliquets et 30 crans d’engagement", while Superstar says "Fast 60 engagement 6 pawl freehub for durable performance out of the box", strange?
