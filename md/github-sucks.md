1. **Not open source**: you are trapped in a SaaS proprietary platform, you cannot run github on premises, our on your laptop
2. **Centralized**: the original promise to have git "decentralised" failed miserably, the "decentralisation" becomes central again 
3. **Censorship**: Github is hosted in the United States, which has nasty laws which does not protect software developers, with laws like the DMCA or millions of software patents
4. **Profiling**: Now that Microsoft bought Github and Linkedin, they can profile you even more
5. **Microsoft**: Microsoft is not an ethical company. Despite the press coverage that "Microsoft has changed", it is still evil.
6. **Money**: Microsoft wants to bill you for Azure minutes, whether it is via Continuous Integration (CI), or via Continuous Deployment (CD).
