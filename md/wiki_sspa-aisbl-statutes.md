In order to promote its goals, the association will notably:

# Definitions


Article 4. A software patent is a patent on any performance of a computer realised by means of a computer program.

# Duration


Article 6. The association is created for an undefined period of time.

# Members


Article 7. The association is composed of physical and/or moral persons, being effective members, contributing members, honor members or others.

Article 8. There is a minimum of three effective members. The first effective members are the founders who constitute the constitutive General Assembly. New effective members can nevertheless be added. In order to become an effective member, the following conditions have to be fulfilled: addressing a written demand to the Board of Administrators as a physical person, expressing its agreement with the statutes and its desire to contribute in an active manner to the social goal. The Board of Administrators approves the demand, except if the applicant is not in a position to positively contribute to the management. However the status of effective member has to be confirmed by the General Assembly, deciding on a two third majority of votes validly casted.

Article 9. A register of members is kept at the registered office of the association and is made available to all members upon request.

Article 10. The quality of contributing member is granted on request by the Board of Administrators to people who commit themselves to respect the statutes; they contribute to the activities of the association and have duly paid their membership fee. The Board of Administrators can grant the title of honorary member or other to any person who wish to bring its participation to the association.

Article 11. The minimum annual fee to be paid by the effective members is determined by the Board of Administrators.

Article 12. The members are free to withdraw from the association at any time by addressing their written resignation notice to the Board of Administrators.

Article 13. The failure to respect the statutes, the default of payment of contributions at the latest within the current month of the registered mail they received by post, the default of attendance of an effective member, represented or excused, to three consecutive general assemblies, the acts or speeches that would harm the interests or the reputation of the association are reasons that can imply the exclusion of a member; nevertheless, this exclusion can only be pronounced by the General Assembly, on a majority of two third of votes validly casted. The Board of Administrators can suspend the members that are concerned until final decision of the General Assembly.

Article 14. Members that are resigning, suspended or excluded, as well as heirs or legal beneficiaries of the deceased member have no right over the social fund. They cannot claim nor require any report, rendering, sealing, inventory.

# General Assembly


Article 15. The General Assembly is the ultimate power of the association. It is formed by all effective members.

* the modification of social statutes;
* the nomination and revocation of administrators and treasurers;
* the approval of budgets and accounts;
* the exoneration of administrators and treasurers;
* the voluntary dissolution of the association;
* the admission and exclusion of an effective member.

Article 17. A General Assembly has to be organised at least once a year within the first semester of the civil year. The association can also be organised in an extraordinary General Assembly at any moment, upon decision of the Board of Administrators or on request of at least one fifth of the effective members. Such demand will have to be addressed to the Board of Administrators by email at least three weeks in advance.

Article 18. The Board of Administrators must convene all effective members to the General Assembly, by electronic mail, at least two weeks before the assembly. The notification will specify the day, time and location of the meeting, as well as the agenda. The Board of Administrators can invite any person to attend, either in part or in full, the General Assembly as an observer or a consultant.

Article 19. Each effective member has the right to participate in the Assembly. He/she can delegate his/her representation to another member or a third party, by giving him/her proxy by means of a proxy form duly dated and signed. Each member or third party can use up to two proxy forms at the maximum.

Article 20. All effective members have the right to vote at the General Assembly, each of them having one single vote.

Article 21. The General Assembly can deliberate whatever the number of members attending, present or represented, unless exceptions provided by law or the present statutes. Decisions of the General Assembly are taken on a simple majority of votes previously expressed, unless otherwise provided by law or the present statutes. In case of vote parity, the General Secretary can double his vote. Blank votes, voids or abstentions are excluded of quorum of vote and majority.

Article 22. The General Assembly releases to the members its moral report, its financial report and the minutes from the previous General Assembly. Besides, the General Assembly only deliberates validly on the items written in the agenda announced in the notification, except in case of emergency determined by the Board of Administrators and the General Assembly, deciding on a two third majority of votes validly casted and provided that the discussed item on the agenda does not relate to a change in the statutes; the "miscellaneous" section only covers items that do not require any vote. In order to be added to the agenda, any item should be previously agreed by at least one third of the administrators or a twentieth of the effective members; it must be communicated to the Board of Administrators at least two weeks before the date of the assembly, together with a note explaining the object in a precise and complete manner.

Article 23. Decisions of the general assemblies are countersigned by an administrator, as well as by effective members upon request. They are collected in a register that all effective members can consult at the headquarters of the association without being allowed to move the register, and that third parties with a legitimate interest can consult by extracts.

Each administrator is entitled to get any package or registered letter at the post office, sign any piece of discharge, accomplish any conservatory act.
