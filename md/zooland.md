# About


Zooland is a new country where there are no regulations on electromagnetic transmissions.

Those regulations are from the past and stifle innovation and development in RF technologies.

They also encourage expensive communications.

Current Radio Frequencies (RF) regulations are a pure spacial and economic waste.
