The default /etc/apt/sources.list file in Lenny is wrong, he is the right one:


    deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian lenny main contrib non-free
    deb http://security.debian.org/debian-security lenny/updates main contrib non-free
    deb http://volatile.debian.org/debian-volatile lenny/volatile main contrib non-free
