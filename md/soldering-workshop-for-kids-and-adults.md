Ingredients:

* pine wood block (dimensions Xcm x Xcm)
* pine wood screws + rondelle
* Hobby Deco Wire 5m (like this <https://www.laboutiquedejuliette.com/164-fil-metallique.html>   or this <https://www.etsy.com/nz/listing/729076259/green-iron-wire>  )
* crocodile heads salvaged from crocodile clips

# DIY USB soldering gun holder


I could not find a decent USB soldering gun holder for those USB soldering guns, so I made one myself out of 2mm think copper wire from Brico.

I used some pine wood cut long enough to have stability.

Ingredients:

* 2mm thick copper wire
* wood (dimensions Xcm x Xcm)
* bolt nut

# What went wrong?


* Some people soldered the LEDs in the wrong order, IMHO there should be some "+" and "-" labelling on the silkscreen of the PCB so that people at least ask themselves which leg of the LED is the "+" or the "-".
* One lamp of the DIY third lamp did not work
* We did not know how to debug the board if it does not work out of the box
* Maybe have some floating battery to test the circuit before soldering the battery
* There should be a switch (in the front) in order to avoid draining the battery during the night
* There should be a magnet to put it on the fridge
* Instructions should have been printed on paper, so that participants are autonomous
* Instructions should be translated to french
* 5 minutes briefing for everybody at the beginning with 3 bullet points

# What's next?


* Make another workshop, find more kids
* Re-order the PCB at DirtyPCB or OSHPark
* Fix the PCB with improvements
* Order a Christmas tree, and add an esp8266?
