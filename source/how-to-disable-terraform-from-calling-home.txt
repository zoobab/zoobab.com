+ Problem1

Terraform is calling home each time you launch it, for example to check the plugins and updates.

I don't think this is a sane thing to do, as you make your terraform installer dependent on the availability of the internet.

I am running terraform in a disconnected from the internet setup, and it took me ages to find out how to disable this 'calling home' feature.

The documention is pretty obscure and scarce regarding on how to do it.

+ Solution1

Use the environment variable 'CHECKPOINT_DISABLE=1', like here:

[[code]]
$ CHECKPOINT_DISABLE=1 terraform init
[[/code]]

+ Problem2

Terraform is still calling home with the CHECKPOINT_DISABLE=1 variable if the plugins are not set to the right version specified in the .tf files.

+ Solution2

The solution is to remove all the precise versions in your code.
