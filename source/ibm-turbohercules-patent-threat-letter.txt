+ About

IBM has sent a patent threat letter to [http://www.turbohercules.com/ TurboHercules], a french open source software company providing support around the Hercules open source [http://www.hercules-390.org/ s390 mainframe emulator]. IBM has been the leading company promoting software patents at the European Patent Office with the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_1173/97 IBM computer program product (T_1173/97)] decision, the [http://eupat.ffii.org/players/ibm/ lobbying for the software patents] directive, or more recently [http://www.digitalmajority.org/forum/t-179907/ibm-says-software-patents-drive-oss-development lobbying the US Supreme Court] on Bilski, arguing that they invest in free software development only because they can get software patents protection.

+ For slashdotters

For people reading this page from Slashdot, I have to confess that IBM is still lobbying for software patents in the European Union though the [http://epla.ffii.org/forum/t-167725/what-s-wrong-with-the-united-patent-litigation-system-upls creation of a central patent court]. IBM, like Microsoft, is actively lobbying in Brussels not to reopen the software patent directive through the Community Patent discussions, and the creation of a central patent court.

If you have time to help, I have opened a [http://www.zoobab.com/wiki:ibm-turbohercules-137-patents public wikipage] and a [http://ietherpad.com/iAqMr9JCXv public iEtherpad pad] to put the tables with the list of the 137 patents in plain text format.

Re: TurboHercules

Dear Mr. Bowler

We have received and considered your letter of November 18, 2009. The comments you provide do not lead IBM to reconsider IBM's position as set out in my letter of November 4, 2009. Your suggestion that TurboHercules was unaware that IBM has intellectual property rights in this area is surprising. IBM has spent many years and many billions of dollars developing its z-architecture and technology, and is widely known to have many intellectual property rights in this area. IBM's litigation against PSI for, among other things, patent infringement and trade secret misappropriation is a matter of public record, and well known in the industry. According to your own statements, your product emulates significant portions of IBM's proprietary instruction set architecture and IBM has many patents that would, therefore, be infringed. For illustration, I enclose with this letter a non-exhaustive list ofIBM u.S. patents that protect innovative elements ofIBM's mainframe architecture and that IBM believes will be infringed by an emulator covering those elements. For your information, the enclosed list also includes a non-exhaustive list of relevant IBM u .s . published patent applications. Apart from concerns about unauthorized use of proprietary IBM information by one or more TurboHercules contributors, IBM therefore has substantial concerns about infringement of patented IBM technology. In these circumstances, I trust you will understand that IBM cannot agree to your request to reconsider its position.

Sincerely,

Mark S. Anzani VP and Chief Technology Officer, IBM System z
