+ TTL 5V

There is a header with TX RX 5V, if you connect to it at 115200, you will get [https://my.st.com/public/STe2ecommunities/mcu/Lists/cortex_mx_stm32/Flat.aspx?RootFolder=https%3a%2f%2fmy%2est%2ecom%2fpublic%2fSTe2ecommunities%2fmcu%2fLists%2fcortex_mx_stm32%2fUSART%2c%20115200%20not%20work&FolderCTID=0x01200200770978C69A1141439FE559EB459D7580009C4E14902C3CDE46A77F0FFD06506F5B&currentviews=811 an "U" every second]:

+ OpenOCD

Apparently you have to use OpenOCD via a JTAG interface to upload code on this board.

+ As a flashrom programmer?

serprog-stm32vcp seems to transform the board in a BIOS flasher.

+ As a JTAG flasher?

There seems to be some support in [http://zjtag.sf.net zjtag] for an [http://is.gd/gHSIcK STM32 cable]:

[[code]]
Hid-Brjtag v2 is working with STM32F103C8TC. The hardware platform could be modified on ST mini 3in1 devlopment kit.
STM32F.pdf shows the required PINs used by Hid-Brjtag v2, You can make yourself hidbrjtag dongle according to.
