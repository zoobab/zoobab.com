++ A DHCP lease of 15 seconds?

While debugging other things, I had a look at my /var/log/syslog messages, and I saw that my DHCP client was requesting an IP address every 15 seconds!. I assume that this is on purpose, but this is a bit too often to my taste.

++ A captive portal not easy to use on mobile phones, while it is one of the main target

The captive portal page should be one simple page which scales well on mobile phones, or stripped down to the minimum, for both normal browsers and mobile phones versions. People wants something functional, not blinky logos and huge images.

++ The authentication server timeout

The authentication server fails to respond often, resulting in server timeouts.
