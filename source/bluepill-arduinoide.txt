This page explains how to blink a LED on the STM32 Bluepill with the Arduino IDE.

+ Serial flashing tool: stm32flash instead of stm32loader

To flash the bootloader with a usb-serial dongle, you can prepare 2 bended squared pins and connect them to A9 and A10 by putting them pushed to the jumper connector, so that they do not move, and connect the GND and VCC to the SWD 4 pins connector. Here is a photo of my setup which does not require any soldering:

stm32flash seems to give much better results then stm32loader, I never managed to get a proper working bootloader in USB with stm32loader:

[[code]]
$ ./stm32flash -w generic_boot20_pc13.bin -v -g 0x0 /dev/ttyUSB0
stm32flash Arduino_STM32_0.9

+ Bootloader waiting half a second

The DFU bootloader only waits one second before switching to another USB PID:

[[code]]
$ lsusb
Bus 001 Device 004: ID 2232:1024 Silicon Motion 
Bus 001 Device 003: ID 8087:07da Intel Corp. 
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 8087:0024 Intel Corp. Integrated Rate Matching Hub
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 003 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
Bus 002 Device 120: ID 1eaf:0003  
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
[[/code]]

After a second, you can see the USB PID changing from "1eaf:0003" (bootloader mode) to "1eaf:0004" (working mode).

This one second delay is not enough to push the RUN button of the Arduino IDE, so we decided to look how to increase it.

After a while, i decided to increase the bootloader mode from 1s to 10s so that it becomes usable with the arduino ide. I pushed my change and binary bootloaders on github:

https://github.com/zoobab/STM32duino-bootloader/commits/master

With 10s delay, it becomes much more usable!
