> Dear Sir,
> 
> Thanks first of all to organize this public consultation on terminal
> equipment required to access the public internet, also known as
> "modems" or "routers".
> 
> Over the last 20 years, I have worked on FLOSS software projects which
> "controls" those consumer routers, such as cable modems, ADSL modems,
> or just simple routers.
> 
> You will find an extensible list of my contributions through my
> personal website:

> http://www.zoobab.com/search:site/q/openwrt
> 
> I have wrote custom software and adapted existing FLOSS and non-FLOSS
> software for widely deployed VDSL modems in Belgium, such as the
> Belgacom Box 1, 2, 3 and 3+.
> 
> In 2010, I found several severe security flaws in the BBOX2 (open
> wifi, open telnet, same publicly known login+password on all those
> boxes), where malicious users could get an administrator shell on the
> router from the street.
> 
> This vulnerability was most probably used to gather thousands of PPP
> credentials from end users around Brussels:

> 
> I made a presentation of my findings at a security conference Hackito
> Ergo Sum in Paris, and Belgacom was notified at the time of the
> security flaws:

> 
> But it took them more then 2 years to fix those obvious security
> problems, despite my communications with their security experts
> decorated with many certifications on its Linkedin profile.
> 
> My conclusion is that we cannot trust some third parties, such as
> ISPs, to have the control of the software in our homes, as it creates
> an insecure point in the network which is being used by malicious
> actors to spy on users, compromise their privacy, and spread malware
> such as miners.
> 
> It is why I urge you to refuse any pressure from the ISPs to put their
> dirty hands on our routers located in our homes.

> Instead of explicitly seeking to sanction the patentability of
> software, they are now seeking to create a central European patent
> court, which would establish and enforce patentability rules in their
> favor, without any possibility of correction by competing courts or
> democratically elected legislators."
