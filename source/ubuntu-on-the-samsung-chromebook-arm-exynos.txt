+ Installation

I have used this script and the procedure documented here:

http://chromeos-cr48.blogspot.be/2013/05/chrubuntu-one-script-to-rule-them-all_31.html

Unfortunately, after the installation of the script with the "lubuntu-desktop lts" option, I did not had any X server nor wifi configured.

I tried many different options, the only one that worked was "ubuntu-desktop lts".
